## Error handling  

In case of error, if you retry immediately and it fails with this error 
```
==> Failed to resize image '/var/lib/waydroid/images/system.img' .. !  e2fsck 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)
/var/lib/waydroid/images/system.img is mounted.
e2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.
```
You need to get the mounting point using `df | grep waydroid`. It will be something like `/dev/loopXXX`. Then, unmount it
```
sudo umount /dev/loopXXX
```
And re-run the script.
